            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:13396:5"/>mention, called <hi>Aristippus,</hi> becauſe he flattered <hi>Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius,</hi> the Tirant of Syracuſa: the interpreter of <hi>Nicephorus</hi> in his Eccleſiaſticall hiſtorie, reporteth, that <hi>Constantine</hi> Emperour of the Romanes, did ſo abhorre Flatterers, that he called them the Moathes and vermine of the Court: <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> did ſo hate them, that hearing one (beyond meaſure) to praiſe him, comparing him with the Gods, he gaue him a blowe on the eare: <hi>Alfonſo</hi> King of Arragon and Sicilia, ſaid that Flatterers were like vnto Wolues, and as Wolues in grating and gnawing vſe to deuoure certaine other beaſts, euen ſo Flatterers tend to the ruine of Princes and great Lords by their flattering and lying.

<pb facs="tcp:13396:5"/>I haue deſired to obſerue two principall poynts, which will preſerue me from incurring the diſhoneſt name of thoſe aboueſaid: the firſt is, that I here ſay not that to your praiſe, which I might well ſay, but doe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther holde my peace, than peraduenture to wander (to no purpoſe) through thoſe ſpacious fields of your prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which ought to be handled by a more skilfull pen than mine.

The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> firſt I ſay,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:13396:11"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> that although that humane actions ſeeme to be ſo ioyned and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled together, that it ſeemeth that, that which now is preſent, hath been; and that which hath been, ought to be againe: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the accidents which follow are ſo different and diuers, that no man whoſoeuer hee be (except very prudent) can alwayes gouerne himſelfe in matters preſent, by the example of that which is paſt.

                  </note> The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which cauſed <hi>Laurence</hi> to take that courſe, were theſe: Firſt, he knew that he had at once to deale with two very mightie enemies, ſtrangers, the one of which was the Pope, the other the King of Naples: and knowing well that hee was not able to reſiſt any one of them alone, hee tooke this reſolution. For his enemies would haue neither truce, nor peace, nor league, or confederacie with him, but would abſolutely put him from his eſtate, and the one of them <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> had alreadie ſought to bereaue him of his life. Secondly, he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that Florence was a free Citie, and much accuſtomed to ſpeake euill; by reaſon whereof, in publike meetings and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies abroad, and in their particular houſes at home, they ſpake euill of him; and he further knew well, that his gouernment could not long continue, ſeeing the Citizens and Burgeſſes did ſo much enuy and malice the glorie of his reputation. Thirdly, he well knew that their chamber of accounts and treaſure of the eſtate was well wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted, and little money remained, ſo as he muſt haue publike ayd and particular mens money to defray the charge of the warre, which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> could not long continue. And fourthly, hee conſidered that this warre began to be tedious and irkſome to his friends: for that it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that it was not vndertaken for the defence of the publike liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, but rather to maintaine the reputation of one man alone. Fiftly, he knew that Pope <hi>Sixtus,</hi> and King <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> had giuen the Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines to vnderſtand, that they had begun this warre, not to the end to depriue or bereaue them of their publike libertie, but to free them from their tyrant, and to ſet them at libertie, ſo as they might be ruled and gouerned, as free men, without depending of the will and pleaſure of one man alone: which did greatly encreaſe their
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:13396:12"/>hatred againſt him.
<note place="margin">Guicciar. lib. 1</note> The ſixt reaſon was, that hee conſidered that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> there was a moſt cruell plague in the citie: ſo as the gentlemen could not abide in the citie, becauſe of the plague; neither could they goe to their houſes and poſſeſſions in the countrie, by meanes of the warres: and therefore they neither could nor would long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure this diſcommoditie for his ſake, neither loſe their liues and goods to maintaine his reputation and greatnes. The ſeuenth rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was, that his hope failed him in the ſuccour of ſtrangers, which conſiſted in the league: for the ſtate of Milan was euen tired through the gouernment of a childe, and of a woman; and by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the diſagreement of the brethrens forces, and chiefly for that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> the Venetians, who were the other foundation and chiefe ſtring of his hope, louing better to lie aloofe off, then to be too, buſie in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termedling in this warre, were not reſolued to ſend him any ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours at his neede.</p>
               <p>Behold the reaſons which moued <hi>Laurence,</hi> wherein he ſhewed his wit, who conſulting with himſelfe, and the greatnes of his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, tooke the benefit of the time. For winter being come, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured and obtained truce for two moneths: and during that time, he acquired and wonne to him the loue and good will of King <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand,</hi> to whom he wrote, that truſting in his owne innocencie, he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> would come vnto him, and leaue the difference and controuerſie to his iudgement and diſcretion, hoping to ſatisfie him in all that ſhould be reaſon. See his wit, concerning his affaires abroad: and as for his buſines at home, he choſe Magiſtrates, Senatours and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, ſuch as hee truſted and knew to be well affected vnto him: hee committed the gouernment of the State to <hi>Thomas Soderini,</hi> a man of great account, and dealt ſo warily, that for pledge and aſſurance of his faith,
<note place="margin">Laurence de Medicis <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to</hi> Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonſe <hi>King of Naples.</hi>
                  </note> hauing with ripe iudgement prouided for all things elſe, he took <hi>Soderini</hi> his ſonne with him to Naples, where he found Fortune very fauourable and gracious vnto him. For notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> that <hi>Laurence</hi> his enemies ſolicited the King to put him to death, yet hee held his word with him, and receiued him royally: and after that hee had heard him in priuate, marueiling at the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of his ſtomacke, and his great wiſedome and experience in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and militarie affayres, hee made peace and a league with him, and ſent him backe againe to Florence, with greater honour and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, then he had at his comming from thence. His ſonne <hi>Peter</hi> to the contrarie had not the like reaſon, neither did he ſhew the like wit, neither had he the like fauourable fortune: for he would obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately

Neither did he wiſely gouerne himſelfe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the affaires within the Citie: for he left not the rule there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> with thoſe who were his friends and well affected vnto him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did hee communicate his determination with thoſe, who were able to giue him good counſell, neither did aſſure to himſelfe the holding of his authoritie: but truſting onely to himſelfe, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerning all after his owne phantaſie, he tooke his iourney. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being ill aduiſed, he ſuddenly put himſelfe into his angrie ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies hands, where fortune likewiſe forſooke him: for he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to grant vnto the King all that hee demaunded, which was exceſſiue and without meaſure, and that he ſhould binde the Citie to that, which was impoſſible for him to ſatisfie and effect: and ſo <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> with very ſmall reputation hee returned to his countrie, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incenſed againſt him, baniſhed him. <hi>Guicciardin</hi> doth wiſely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late this matter, and withall giueth this aduice, ſaying: That it is a very dangerous matter for a man to gouerne himſelfe by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of another man, if the like occurrences concurre not.</p>

When the Engliſh came where their goods and riches were diſperſt, and ſcattered abroad, the King com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded that no man ſhould touch the ſame, but that they ſhould purſue the enemie; whom, when they had ouercome, they ſhould then haue time enough to recouer, and againe gather together the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> goods which they had loſt. But there was a Knight of the Brittons amongſt them, which againſt the Kings commaundement, ſaid: That it was no wiſedome, but a ſigne of great feare, to doubt to take their owne goods, whereſoeuer they found them: and ſeeing that the enemie of their owne accord did voluntarily forſake and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the bootie, which they would haue had by force and hazard of their liues; for the recouerie thereof, hee found it not expedient, with the price of their blood, and great daunger, to buy that, which they might take and poſſeſſe in quiet, and peaceably for nothing.

               <p>The Venetian ſouldiers committed the like error in the yeere 1509. euen then, when almoſt al the Princes of Chriſtendome were vnited together againſt their Common-wealth: for the Venetian armie, led by <hi>Bartelmy Liuiano,</hi> hauing taken Treui, in the very beard of the enemies, amongſt which was the King of France in perſon, the ſouldiers gaue themſelues to ſack &amp; pillaging; and whileſt they were buſie about their luggage, the Kings armie paſſed the riuer of Adde, without let or reſiſtance: for that the ſouldiers were ſo buſie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> in pillaging, that it was not poſſible, either by authoritie, or by their Captaines threatnings, to make them giue ouer the ſacking of the towne. And although that th'Aluian ſet the towne on fire, to the end to bring them to fight, yet was it too late: for the Kings armie hauing (at eaſe, and very commodiouſly) paſt the riuer, and hauing had leiſure to put themſelues in order, there followed the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable feate of armes, of <hi>Giarad' Adde,</hi> wherein the Venetians (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out queſtion) had been victors, if their ſouldiers, in ſtead of pilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, would haue been brought to hinder and ſtop the paſſage of the French armie: for they had either ouerthrowne them and put <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> them to flight, or elſe conſtrained them to fight without order, and at great diſaduantage, or to returne backe, which had giuen them cauſe of a moſt manifeſt and moſt noble victorie, which was taken out of their hands by their owne ſouldiers, who were ſo greedie that they rather loued to glut themſelues with luggage,

And this accident was further noted, in that, that <hi>Sauonarola</hi> after the death of theſe fiue Gentlemen in any of his orations (although he made many) did neither accuſe, nor excuſe any of them, which were breakers of this Lawe: for he blamed none, becauſe he would not be found contrarie to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> and he could not excuſe himſelfe, becauſe the matter was ſo manifeſt, and the refuſing to maintaine the Lawe, ſo notorious, that he was inexcuſable.

Therefore I ſay, that euery officer or miniſter hauing charge, ought to conſider with what ſuperiours he hath to deale:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> and to knowe his Princes inclination, for if he be obſtinate, hard headed, crabbed, ſeuere and cruell, he ought not in any caſe to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede the Commiſſion preſcribed vnto him, notwithſtanding, that to breake it, were greatly to his Maſters good and profit: for it might be, that the Prince would be perſwaded, that his ſeruant or Commiſſioner did paſſe his authoritie, to the end to ſhew himſelfe wiſer than his Maſter, and ſo diſliking his good ſeruice, cauſe him to be puniſhed.

Firſt, to recouer and get againe their honor loſt, in forſaking and abandoning their firſt friend in time of neede: which maketh a man very blame worthie, except vrgent occaſion force it. Secondly, to let the world know that the fact by him committed was not through his malice, but through the fault of his firſt friend, who vpon ſome occaſion had conſtrained him to leaue him. Thirdly, hee continueth firme and conſtant in his friendſhip, to repaire and amend the lightnes of the firſt, which cannot be amended but by the firme conſtancie of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> ſecond.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> lightnes and inconſtancie with the ſecond as they did with the firſt, it ſhall be good not to contemne it, but to liue with them, in ſuch ſort that whenſoeuer their mindes begin to change, their changing be neither dammageable or dangerous. The moſt wiſe Emperour <hi>Charles</hi> the 5. refuſed not, neither contemned the friendſhip of the Duke of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> who forſooke (in his greateſt need) his firſt friend and Lord <hi>Francis</hi> the firſt King of France; but entertained and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced his friendſhip, vſing him very honourably: and <hi>Bourbon</hi> in this ſecond friendſhip alway carried himſelfe very faithfully, and did the Emperour great ſeruice: and although that he knew well <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> that in the Emperours Court he was not beloued, yet for all that he remained euer firme and conſtant in the Emperours ſeruice. But notwithſtanding all this, in like caſes which depend on the faith of another, a man ought (as I haue ſaid) to be weladuiſed, and not ſo to ſettle his affection on a man, as to place his whole heart vpon him, but to proceed ſo wiſely, that although he change his minde, and be inclined to the friendſhip of the firſt friend, or of any other, that it annoy him not. And for this cauſe, the aforeſaid Emperour did ſo beare himſelfe with the warlike Prince, <hi>Charles</hi> of Bourbon, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaining him with honourable parts, and hauing made him his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Generall in Italie, and at the laſt ſent him into Lumbardie to the gouernment of a deſperate armie, hee conſidered that he could not greatly annoy him, if peraduenture he altered his determination: which, as a conſtant and vertuous Prince, hee did not.

For this cauſe, without annoying or any way offending the Emperour, being wholy ruinated, hee returned to Venice, and fell into ſuch diſgrace and hatred of the people, that they killed him.

Many examples might be alleaged hereof, as of the Saguntines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged by <hi>Hanniball,</hi> but I will content my ſelfe with the example of the Piſans, happened in the time of our anceſtors.</p>
               <p>The Florentines made long warres againſt the Piſans, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times vanquiſhed them, and euer vſed them very hardly, and in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> concluſion they reſolued to inuade and to bring them to their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience through hunger, and euery yeere ſpoyled their harueſt, and often bereaued them of hope of any for the yeere following, but they made prouiſion from elſewhere. At length the Florentines de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to trie them by gentlenes and clemencie, to ſee if curteſie might preuaile, to the end to leaue nothing vntried: And for this cauſe they made a new law, &amp; ordained that euery citizen or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triman of Piſa, which within certaine time would returne to dwell in his houſe or poſſeſſion in the countrie, ſhould haue free pardon

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> for any thing that he had committed, and ſhould reenter vpon his goods. The Florentines did this in hope to haue drawne many Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſans out of the towne by meane of this law, by which meanes the towne would be weaker, and worſe defended: but their hope failed them, and al happened to the contrarie. For that many which were vnprofitable for the wars, by the conſent and leaue of the reſt went out of Piſa, and the citie remained disburthened,
<note place="margin">The Piſans loue better to ſubiect them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to the Genouais their mortall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, then to the Floren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, their Lords, neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and friends.</note> and in part diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of the dearth which oppreſſed them: and thoſe which went forth (no leſſe obſtinate then thoſe which remained within) for the defence of the citie, with their reuenues did ſecretly ſuccour and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> relieue thoſe which remained within; in ſuch ſort, as that they which defended the citie would not yeeld but by force, and thoſe which were abroad by no meanes could be mollified, abhorring nothing ſo much as the name of a Flore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tine.

The ſecond is this, that the French, which are now cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Lombards, inuaded Tuſcane, and particularlie the Citie of Chiuſi: wherefore the Chiuſins ſent to deſire ayde and ſuccour of the Romans, amongſt which it was determined, that the three Fabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and ſhould goe to the French, and require them to forbeare to make warre againſt the Tuſcanes.

Where being knowne by the French, they turned all their wrath and diſpleaſure <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> againſt the Romanes, which they before had conceiued againſt the Tuſcanes: and this diſpleaſure grew in this, that the French hauing framed a complaint by their Ambaſſadours to the Senate of Rome, requiring that the Fabians ſhould be deliuered into their hands, to be puniſhed: but the Romanes were ſo farre from deliuering or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing them, that when the time came to create new Magiſtrates, they were made Tribunes, with Conſularie dignitie. Wherefore the French, ſeeing them raiſed to dignitie and great honour, which they deſired to haue ſeene puniſhed, and aſſuring themſelues, that that which was done, was done in deſpite of them; full ſwolne with

<note place="margin">The greatnes of courage of the Romane Common-wealth.</note> The example of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth conſiſteth in this, that after the loſſe of the battaile of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas, which was the third, the Romanes were not out of heart, nor diſcouraged, neither would they ranſome their priſoners, nor ſend Ambaſſadours to <hi>Hanniball,</hi> but put another armie into the fields. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> Behold what hee ſaith of excellent men and mightie Common-wealths: and then turning to weake men and weake Common-wealths, hee ſaith, that they which are of ſmall heart and little cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, are otherwiſe gouerned: for through their vanitie they are proude and inſolent in proſperitie, and ſo make themſelues odious to their neighbours: and when fortune turneth her backe and changeth countenance, they become ſo baſe and abiect, that they doe nothing worthie their greatnes: and ſo concludeth, that the vertue of retaining courage is ſeene in the Romanes, and that the vice of baſenes, and to become abiect, was ſeene in the Venetians: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and with many words continueth blaming them, and noteth al that they did after that battaile, calling them baſe and cowards, ſeeing that hauing but halfe loſt a battaile at Vaila, they yeelded to the Pope his townes and countrie, and to the King of Spaine his ports and Hauens; and to the Emperour his townes, declaring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues his Tributaries, offering to pay 50000.

But <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> to come neere to the particular, and to ſhew that the Common-wealth of Venice hath not deſerued ſo great blame, I will aske of the author of this diſcourſe certaine queſtions, by the which it ſhall appeare that the Lords of Venice dealt wiſely, and not like fooles and ill aduiſed: and grounded vpon certaine rules and precepts, which this author giueth in diuers places, it ſhall be ſeene that they failed not in doing as they did. Firſt I remember to haue read in one of his diſcourſes, wherein he ſheweth that the Romanes neuer had two warres together at one time, although they had many one after another, but not two at any one time together: ſtanding vpon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> this ground, I would aske the author how the Romanes would haue behaued themſelues and maintained their greatnes, if after the ouerthrow of Cannas by <hi>Hanniball,</hi> they had had to deale with foure <hi>Hannibals</hi> togethers at one inſtant, all conſpired to their ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw and ruine? I am of opinion, that being oppreſſed by their ill fortune, they would hardly haue retained the hautie courage which they ſhewed, hauing to deale but with one. Wherefore, if the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians, after their ouerthrow at Vaila, had had to deale but with the King of France alone, as the Romanes with <hi>Hanniball</hi> alone, this halfe ouerthrow of Adda had not made them ſo much diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> yea they would not haue taken any great care, (with the reſt of the armie which was ſaued, with the Earle of <hi>Patiglian,</hi> and one of their Pouruours, amounting to the number of 25000. men, and with many others which were gathered and ioyned togethers) but would haue reſiſted the King, and retained their former courage, and peraduenture ſurmounted their aduerſarie. But being to fight not onely againſt one enemie, but againſt fiue or ſixe at once, vnited and coniured together, who had concluded in the Caſtle of Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bray, and reſolued to ruinate them, and to make warre againſt them
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:13396:48"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> all at one inſtant, and euery one apart: it is not to bee wondred at, though they could not ſhew the vertue that was within them, by their exteriour forces; ſeeing that according to the common Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbe men ſay, <hi>Ne Hercules contra duos,</hi> that <hi>Hercules</hi> himſelfe is not ſufficient to fight againſt two at once: one onely Common-wealth then, could worſe reſiſt and make head againſt Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, the Emperour, the kings of Fraunce and of Spaine, beſides other pettie Princes, which altogether roſe and made warre againſt them in diuers places, as the Duke of Ferrara, the Marques of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toua, and the Frangipani, Infrioli. So as it could not be ſaid, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> the Lords of Venice had not one only warre (as the Romanes had) but foure together, and each of them with great Princes, each of which was ſufficiently able to wage warre with them alone; for this cauſe the Common-wealth of Venice, did not deſerue to be recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the nomber of the weake Common-wealths, neither was there any compariſon betweene the diſgraces happened to Rome, and that which befell the Venetians.</p>
               <p>And moreouer ſeeing that the Venetian Common-wealth, by the Authour of theſe diſcourſes, is placed in rancke with weake Common-wealthes, he ought rather for pitie to haue excuſed the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> weakeneſſe and debilitie thereof, then to haue charged it with co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardize, and to be baſely diſcouraged: for a weake perſon ſhewing weakeneſſe and debilitie, deſerueth not to be blamed for it, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be pitied. Furthermore a man may ſay, that the Venetians loſt not the vertue of their courage, but concealed and hid it for a time: ſo as it plainely appeareth, that ſo ſoone as there was but one haire of fortunes periwig preſented vnto them, &amp; that there began to ſhine but one little ſun-beame of hope, but preſently they tooke hold thereof: and then manifeſting the vertue which for a time lay hidden, they boldly reentred into their enterpriſes; and mocking at <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the leagues and forces of their enemies vnited againſt them, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered and in ſhort ſpace reconquered all that, which they had (ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther let goe aſtray) then loſt in Lombardy. To the reſt the ſame Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour in the eleuenth diſcourſe of his third booke,
<note place="margin">☞</note> giueth a rule and aduertiſement: that when many that are puiſſant and mightie are ioyned and vnited togethers againſt one other, that is mightie, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that they all being vnited be farre mightier then hee, a man ought neuertheleſſe to hope better of him alone which is the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, then in all them, although in number they be moſt mightie, for this, that he alone vſing a little induſtrie, may diſunite and ſeparate
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:13396:49"/>them aſunder; prouided alwayes, that he be ſo valorous, as that hee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> may be able to reſiſt the firſt bru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of their aſſaults, temporizing and attending occaſion. Heare what this Authour ſaith, and after ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and alleadgeth the example of the Venetians, when in the yeere 1484. they had all Italie banded againſt them, by which meanes they were wholy ouerthrowne and vndone, and could not keepe the field with their armie, through an agreement made with <hi>Lewes More</hi> gouernour of Milan, and a practiſe and deuice they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered themſelues of that trouble, recouered the countrie which they had loſt, and vſurped part of the Dutchie of Ferrara. This ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertiſement being founded vpon the example of the Venetians,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> I know not wherefore a man ſhould impute that to their baſenes now, which was then accounted for good induſtrie: and I know not wherefore a man ſhould ſay of them, that in the yeere 1484. they were wiſe men, and that in the yeere 1508. they were ill adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. There were many which were puiſſant, vnited againſt one that was puiſſant: they which were vnited and conioyned togethers, were more mightie than this alone; how could the Venetian Lords then hope to haue the better, and to diſunite the Princes, vnited and combined in league togethers to their ruine, but to ſerue their turnes by induſtrie? to grant vnto the Pope that which he inſtantly <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> demaunded; to giue to the King of Spaine thoſe Ports which hee deſired; and to demonſtrate vnto the Emperour that they would doe that which he required? wherefore ſhould that be accompted baſenes, which afterwards ſhewed it ſelfe to be wiſedome? And if the Venetians were not ſo valorous, as to reſiſt and ſupport the firſt force and aſſault, they found neuertheleſſe the meanes to tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize, vntil they might be able to diſunite the other Princes from the King of France, againſt whom was the principall quarrell, and by whom they were ouercome and put to flight: and for this cauſe they gaue eſpeciall charge to <hi>Anthony Iuſtinian</hi> their Ambaſſadour <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> with the Emperour, to conclude a peace with him vpon what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſoeuer. They ſent no Ambaſſadours to the French King, who had ouercome and defeated them, neither to raunſome their priſoners, neither did they make any ſhew to ſtand in any doubt of him alone. Wherefore the reſolution of theſe Lords was, to haue warres onely with him, as the Romanes had with <hi>Hanniball</hi> alone: and therefore they vſed all meanes to bring it to paſſe that he might remaine alone, for that they doubted not ſo to vnite and reinforce their troupes, to fight with him, and to ouercome him if poſſiblie:
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:13396:49"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> And whoſoeuer ſhall with iudgement reade <hi>Guicciardin,</hi> ſhall ſee that the Venetian Lords did very wiſely, to vſe this expedition to diſunite the Princes: for they were no leſſe to feare ſome ciuill tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult within their walles, then the enemies armies abroad: vpon this accident which might happen, the Fathers and Senatours vſed great conſideration. And although that <hi>Guicciardin</hi> doe note them of a little feare and of a too ſudden deſpaire; I ſay, neuertheleſſe that it more auaileth to be wiſely fearfull, then raſh and fooliſhly hardy: for ſometimes the faining of feare hath ſerued mens turnes in many occaſions and occurrences. Moreouer, the author of the ſaid diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> in the fourteenth of his ſecond booke, ſpeaking of the ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring any thing through feare, which appertaineth to another man, ſaith,
<note place="margin">☞</note> That when a man hath to deale with one man alone, the yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vp of any thing through puſillanimitie, will not appeaſe him, but that he will haue more: but when a man is to anſwere to many enemies, when thou ſhalt reſtore to ſome one, that which appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth vnto him, thereby to winne him to thee, and to diſunite and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate him from the reſt of the confederates againſt thee, (although that the warre were alreadie open) this plot and counſell is good: ſee what he ſaith. Reſting my ſelfe vpon this his foundation, I ſay, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> the Lords of Venice hauing to deale with many enemies vnited to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gethers, and the warre being alreadie open, did wiſely to giue to ſome one of them, that which belonged vnto him, to diſunite him from the reſt of the allies and confederates: and therefore they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued not to be blamed, ſeeing they followed this counſel, ſo much approued by the author of this diſcourſe. And further, in the 11. diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of his third booke, he ſaith: That the Venetians in the yeere 1508. were ruinated, for that they had no valorous armies, nor meanes to temporize, neither time nor oportunitie to ſeparate nor diſunite the confederates: and addeth further, that they might haue giuen part to ſaue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> the reſt, and if they had made reſtitution in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it would not haue ſeemed to haue beene done through neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: and if before the rumour of the warre, it had been a wiſe and prudent aduice; but in the time of the warre it was ſcandalous, and of little profit. Grounding my ſelfe vpon theſe words, I ſay, that the Venetians did wiſely to proceede in this manner. And that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this diſcourſe (noting want of wit in whoſoeuer ſhall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceede as they did) ought to remember what hee hath written, and preſcribed for a rule of eſtate in the ſecond booke the 14. diſcourſe, which is this: That oftentimes men are deceiued, which thinke by
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:13396:50"/>humilitie to ouercome arrogancie, and his words are ſuch as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low:<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/>
                  <note place="margin">Proude men are hardly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſed by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militie.</note> No Prince ought to omit any part of his degree, neither ought to leaue or giue vp any thing by compoſition, (if he will honorablie leaue it) except it be when hee is able, or thinketh himſelfe able to hold it: for it is better to ſuffer it to be taken perforce, (the buſines being brought to ſuch termes, that it cannot be left in the manner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid) then to leaue it for feare of forces. For if thou leaue it for feare, and thou doeſt ſo to the end to deliuer thee from warre, moſt commonly thou getteſt nothing thereby; and for that that hee to whom (through apparant feare) thou haſt yeelded ought, will not bee contented, but will haue yet more, and will bee inflamed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> thee, and leſſe eſteeme thee, and thou ſhalt finde forrein aide very weake; but hauing diſcouered thy aduerſaries drift, if thou put thy ſelfe in order, and prepareſt thy forces, although they be leſſe then his forces are, hee will begin to regard and make account of thee. From theſe words a man may draw many concluſions, to proue that the proceeding of the Lords of Venice, in this great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and diſaſter of fortune, was not baſe, but wiſe and well ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed: and the concluſions are theſe, that humilitie vanquiſheth not arrogancie; and that a man ought to giue nothing to the enemie before the warre; and that it auaileth more to loſe by force, then <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> through the feare of force; and that whoſoeuer doth yeeld or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore that which belongeth to another, thereby to diſunite enemies confederated and in league together, doth wiſely. The firſt reaſon then is this, and may be framed in this manner: Pride and arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie cannot bee ſurmounted by humilitie: the Venetians rendring that which belonged to others, had ſhewed themſelues humble and abiect, and ſo conſequently had not abated the pride of thoſe Princes, and hauing granted that which they required, they would not haue been contented, but would haue had more. A man may frame the ſecond in this manner: Thou ſaiſt that the Venetians <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> made no reſtitution at ſuch time as they ſhould haue done it; I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund at what time they ſhould haue made reſtitution? By thy rule they ought not to haue rendred before the warre was moued, for feare to make ſhew of feare; neither vpon the taking of armes, for that were a matter ſcandalous: it ſhall then bee well done to make reſtitution vpon the experience of the warre. But the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians made no reſtitution before the warre, neither vpon the point thereof; they did well then to parle and treate of reſtitution after the battaile. A man may thus frame the third: It is better to ſuffer a
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:13396:50"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> thing to bee taken away by force, then to abandon it for feare of force: the Venetians ſuffered that which belonged to others, to be taken from them by force, and did not abando<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it for feare of force: they did better then in proceeding in this manner, then to haue made reſtitution before the triall of armes. The fourth is framed thus: Whoſoeuer doth render that which belongeth to another, thereby to ſeparate him from his confederates, doth wiſely. The Venetians made reſtitution, to the end to ſeparate the Princes vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt them, they gouerned themſelues wiſely, and their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of proceeding was aduiſed &amp; not weake, being wiſely fearefull. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> As for the matter where the author aforeſaid ſaith, that the Veneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are inſolent in their proſperitie, and that they called the French King the ſonne of S. Marke, they made no account of the Church, neither could they hold themſelues in quiet in all Italie; I ſay that it is an ordinary vice among men, and that they can hardly containe themſelues within the bounds of modeſtie, in fortunate and happie times; and it is more poſſible to make no ſhew of melancholie in an ill time, then not to be ioyfull in good times,
<note place="margin">Joy cannot be hidden.</note> for it is more eaſie to conceale ſorrow then ioy, the which being vnable to be contained within a mans breaſt, of force will ſhew it ſelfe in ſome one manner <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> or other. A man might alſo ſay, that there is no heede to be taken to the ſpeeches of the common people, the which naturally is of cuſtome inſolent, and to vſe ill and vnſauourie ſpeeches, chiefly in a free Citie as Venice is: neither ought a man to regard or make any reckoning of the ſpeeches and diſcourſes of young gentlemen, which yet haue not had any experience in the affaires of the world, who in proſperitie cannot chuſe but ſhew themſelues pleaſant and ioyfull at the happie ſucceſſe of their countrie, vaunting of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes thereof, as if they were their owne, and ſometimes let ſlip ſome words, which ſent a great deale more of pride and vaine-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> then of modeſtie: but regard is to be had of the words of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natours and graue Fathers, which ſuffering not themſelues to bee carried away with the paſſion of the minde, haue their tongues con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to their braines and ſenſes. And if Princes which are held and reputed for wiſe, ſhew themſelues inſolent and puft vp with pride in proſperitie,
<note place="margin">Lewes More, <hi>Gouernour of Milan, cauſed himſelfe to be called the ſonne of Fortune.</hi>
                  </note> and endeuour to extoll themſelues through proud and ambitious titles, as did <hi>Lewes More,</hi> who called himſelfe (and would that others alſo ſhould doe the like) the ſonne of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. Should a man then marueile though the Venetians through inſolencie called the French King the ſonne of S. Marke? And it
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:13396:51"/>is a common ſaying, that euery dog will barke at his maſters doore,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and euery cocke will crow vpon his owne dunghill. Wherefore ſhould a man make ſuch account of the inſolencie of the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, which in fine hurteth none but themſelues, and paſſeth not their lakes and channels of waters: a man ſhould not ſpeake ſo much of ſo meane a matter. As for this, that the author of this diſcourſe alleageth, that the Venetians ſent to make themſelues Tributaries to the Emperour, and to pay him yeerely 50000. Ducats for tribute: Some hold this to be but a falſe rumour bruted abroad, becauſe that theſe Lords ſent <hi>Anthony Iuſtinian</hi> to accord with the Emperour vpon whatſoeuer condition: whereupon many things were ſpoken <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of, without any ground or foundation, and the Ambaſſadour (a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid) neuer came before the Emperour, neither paſſed he Trent, becauſe the Biſhop of that towne would not giue him audience, he went no further, but returned againe to Venice. And it is the more vnlikely that they would offer themſelues Tributaries to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour for this, that vpon ſome occaſion the league of Cambray was broken. And put the caſe that the Emperour had ſtaied with his forces alone, the Venetians had no reaſon to ſtand in feare of doubt thereof, in any ſuch ſort, that that feare ſhould make them perpetuall Tributaries to the Empire: and the letters which were <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> written by the Senate to the Pope, were not ſo full of puſillanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, feare, or cowardiſe, as ſome report, but with a Chriſtian reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and graue humilitie, for the deſire they had to be abſolued of the cenſures and excommunications of the Church, of which ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution they made more account, then of ſundrie townes, and to appeaſe the wrath of the Pope, who ſeemed to bee highlie diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with them, becauſe of his countries, and finally to ſeparate and diſunite him from the King of France, as they did: and to the ſame end they rendred the Ports of Puglia to the King of Spaine. As for the Oration which <hi>Guicciardin</hi> is ſaid to haue tranſlated word <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> for word out of the Latin, which he ſetteth downe as recited by the Ambaſſadour <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> before the Emperour, I ſay it might well bee true, that <hi>Guicciardin</hi> had ſeene, and had this Oration, for that that at Rome, and in ſundrie places of Italie, many copies were to bee ſeene by the fault of many Secretaries, or mens curioſitie, which make profeſſion to haue certaine ſecret and ſingular matters: and euerie man knoweth that when ſuch copies paſſe many mens hands, a man may eaſily adde, not onely words, but euen whole ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences. But may it not be found that <hi>Guicciardin</hi> fained it, and drew
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:13396:51"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> it out of <hi>Hannibals</hi> oration to <hi>Scipio,</hi> written by <hi>Titus Liuius,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are the very ſame conceits: for he had no reaſon to compile ſuch a tale, when as he might ſummarily ſhew the ſubſtance and content of the legation and the Ambaſſage of <hi>Iuſtinian,</hi> as by his hiſtorie a man may ſee many others diſperſed: but for as much (as I haue ſaid) many copies were to be ſeene, and peraduenture before <hi>Iuſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> parted from Venice, <hi>Guicciardin</hi> may bee exempted from the reproch and ſlander to haue forged it, to the diſhonour of the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notians. And for concluſion. I ſay, that a man ought not too haſtily to condemne either Princes or Common-wealths of debilitie or <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> puſillanimitie, when they are ſurpriſed by ſome force and great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurie and oppreſſion of fortune, which ſurmounteth their forces, and when feare falleth vpon them, (which may trouble and ſhake any man be hee neuer ſo conſtant) and I know not how the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth of Rome would haue ſhewed her excellencie, if it had had to deale with ſo many enemies together, as Venice had. And in giuing place to the mightie oppreſſion and force of Fortune, a man loſeth neither his excellencie nor courage: for to fight and loſe through obſtinacie, rather then by giuing place to the furie and ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of fortune, to aſſay to auoide the perill and trouble, is audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> but not valour; and raſhnes, rather then prudence.</p>

<note place="margin">Animperfect victorie is the ſeede, roote, and beginning of another warre.</note> that an imperfect victorie is the ſeede of another future warre; the vertue and forces remaining yet in the enemie to renue the warre, to fight againe, and to bring you into new trouble and danger. And when I ſay, that the victorie is vaine, I ſpeake not of that vanitie, which ſignifieth little or nothing at all: but I meane that it hath not that perfection and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes in it ſelfe, as the other before ſpoken of.
<note place="margin">Victorie is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times the cauſe of many vices.</note> When a man doth not throughly know theſe imperfect victories, they of cuſtome do draw after them many vices, as negligence, immoderate ioy, inſolencie, and little regard of the enemie, vices truly pernicious and full of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> dangers, eſpecially the confidence that a man hath that he ſhall no more receiue any iniurie or hurt of the enemie; which confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence maketh the victors ſo ioyfull and pleaſant, that they take no care for any other thing, omitting the purſuit of the victorie, which they care not to aſſure &amp; confirme in ſuch ſort, that it may be plaine and perfect, bringing with it true reſt and publike peace.

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> In the yeere 1512. after the memorable iourney of Rauenna, where the French had ſo bloody a victorie, that it was hard to iudge whether partie had the worſe, either the victour or the vanquiſhed: being impoſſible to conclude and accord any agreement betweene the Pope and the King of France, the Swiſſers came to ſerue the Pope, of whoſe valour and power the French ſtood much in feare. The Swiſſers hauing taken the way towards Trent to ioyne with the Venetian armie, came downe into the countrie of Verona: and the French not knowing what courſe they would take,
<note place="margin">Guicciar. li. 10</note> were before gone to Pontoglio to ſtop their paſſage: but the Swiſſers hauing

The Pope was highly diſpleaſed with this iniurie,
<note place="margin">Gucciar. li. 10.</note> and when Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logne returned againe vnder the command of the Church, after the French were driuen out of Italie, if he had not beene preuented by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> death, (as the report went, whether it were true or falſe) he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in reuenge of that iniurie, to haue deſtroyed the citie of Boulogne, and to haue reduced the inhabitants into the citie of Cento, and alreadie began to ſtay the chuſing of Magiſtrates, and not to commit them in any place of any honour or gouernment: yea and by meanes of his rude and ſeuere officers hee drew a great ſumme of money from thoſe citizens, which claue to the faction of the <hi>Bentiuogli:</hi> and if death had not interrupted his conceits, he was a man very likely to haue effected what hee had proiected in his mind.

And becauſe men doe oftentimes deceiue themſelues herein, I ſhall not doe amiſſe to corroborate this which I haue ſpoken with two examples, by the which a man may know how ill they are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed, and what error they commit, which leaue and refuſe a good offer, vpon hope to haue a better. And if there bee daunger in all things to be gouerned by ſuch hope, it is yet moſt dangerous in the warres, when a man hath to deale with mightie enemies, with whom it were farre better to come to an honeſt and good agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then hoping in vaine to haue a better, and not contenting (as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> it were) to winne, but would ouerwin.</p>
               <p>The example drawne out of the ancients, is that of the citie of Tyre, which ſtood in the water as Venice doth now:
<note place="margin">Plutarch <hi>in the life of</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander.</note> 
                  <hi>Alexander</hi> the great hauing conquered the Eaſt, the Tyrians ſeeing his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, ſent him Ambaſſadours to offer him their ſeruice, and to yeeld him ſuch obedience as it ſhould pleaſe him; yet vpon this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they would receiue neither himſelfe, neither any of his people into their citie. <hi>Alexander</hi> being diſpleaſed that one ſuch towne ſhould ſhut the ports againſt him, whom all the Eaſt had receiued, reiecting both the Ambaſſadours, and the conditions of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:13396:59"/>he reſolued to ſend thither his Armie. The Citie of Tyre (as I haue ſaid) was built in the water, well walled, and furniſhed with all things for the defence thereof, in ſuch ſort, that <hi>Alexander</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing beſieged it the ſpace of foure moneths, knew well, that to ſtay there, was but to diminiſh his glorie, and to loſe time; whereas in the meane time, by the conqueſt of many other countries he might encreaſe the ſame: and for this cauſe he concluded to accept of the conditions offered him before, and to graunt to them, that which they demanded, and ſo beganne to parle of an agreement. But the Tyrians ſwolne with pride, and fierce, by reaſon of the reſiſtance which they had made, would not ſo much as accept of any agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> or compoſition, but they ſlue thoſe which came to parle with them thereof. Wherewith <hi>Alexander</hi> beeing much moued, with ſuch furie and obſtinacie he aſſaulted the Towne, that taking it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force,
<note place="margin">Alexander <hi>the great deſtroyed the citie of Tyre.</hi>
                  </note> he razed it to the ground, and ſlue the one halfe of all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and the other halfe he made ſlaues. And then the Tyrians to their whole ſubuerſion and vtter ruine of their Countrey knew, that it had been better for them, to haue accepted of the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which they themſelues had offered, then vainely perſwading themſelues to ouercome <hi>Alexander,</hi> and to haue obtained better, which was to make the enemie to giue ouer his enterpriſe, and with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> ſhame and diſhonour to raiſe his ſiege, which had redounded to their glorie.</p>
               <p>The other example is taken out of the hiſtories of <hi>Guicciardin</hi> in an action of the Florentine Common-wealth: which was, that in the yeere 1512. an armie of Spaniards came into the Seignorie of Florence, for three cauſes, to wit, to alter the Gouernement; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh the <hi>de Medicis</hi> in Florence, and to draw ſome money from their Common-wealth. The altering and chaunging of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, conſiſted, in taking away the authoritie of Magiſtracie from <hi>Peter Soderini,</hi> who was Gonfalonier for terme of his life. The <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> returne of the <hi>de Medicis,</hi> was to be on condition, that they ſhould, liue as priuate Citizens: and the ſumme of money which the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards required, was not ſuch, but that the Florentines might very eaſily haue paid it. The Spaniards had not that fauour which was promiſed them, by many Citizens, who had offered themſelues to take armes in their behalfe, ſo ſoone as it ſhould come to their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that they were arriued in that Seignorie. Wherefore victuals and other neceſſarie prouiſions beginning to faile, they aſſayed to come to ſome compoſition, and there beeing no more queſtion of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:13396:59"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> changing of the State, which was granted, and of the returne of the <hi>de Medicis</hi> in like manner, but all the matter reſted in paying a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſumme of money, which exceeded not 30000. Ducats: and that out of the towne of Prato, before which the Spaniſh Armie then lay, victuals ſhould be giuen, vntill that the articles of agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were ratified. But the Florentines, moued with a vaine hope of preuailing, without accepting of any of theſe conditions, delai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their reſolution, and finally would not accept of this agreement (the three points being reduced into one,) which was of the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the money. Wherefore the Spaniards conſtrained through <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> neceſſitie and deſpite, ſpoyled the towne of Prato moſt miſerably,
<note place="margin">Prato ſacked by the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards.</note> and put the whole eſtate of Florence to great paine and trouble. He then committeth a great fault, which is aſſailed by a mightie ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and accepteth not of the reaſonable conditions which are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him, in hope to preuaile without them. The Citie of Tyre ought to haue been contented, when <hi>Alexander</hi> yeelded to graunt vnto them the conditions, which they themſelues before had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, and to haue made ſo great a Warriour to conſent to their wils. It ought alſo to haue ſufficed the Florentines, when ſo many conditions propounded by the Spaniards were reduced into one: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> and it was a ſufficient Conqueſt, that the Spaniſh Armie did yeeld to any of their demands, without the performance of all that which they had required. But the ambition of the Gonfalonier, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfull hope of the people, and the deſire of glory in him which gouerned, put the State in great hazard. So ſhall it euer come to thoſe, which grounded vpon the vanitie of their conceits, loue bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fooliſhly to follow the deceitfull hope of better fortune, then to embrace and wiſely accept of good and reaſonable offers: for a good compoſition can neuer be ſo baſe, but that it is ſome honour to him which accepteth thereof, and a man ought by ſo much the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> more to conſider of this point, by how much more the enemie with whom he is to deale, is mightie and puiſſant.</p>

And finally the Iſle of Cypres being aſſailed in the yeere 1570. by the Turkes forces, had hope of ſuccours (though farre off) from the Lords of Venice. The leagues and confederacies are then much better which are made with neighbours neere at hand, and thoſe which may be eaſily called, and may eaſily helpe.

And for this cauſe, when two or three, or more haue power, to ioyne themſelues together, a man ought not then to be ſlowe in aſſembling and vniting his forces, and to ſend them ſpeedely where <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> neede requireth, becauſe oftentimes they come too late.

               <p>I remember that I read in <hi>Muzio Iuſtinopolitan,</hi> an example of an officer of ſmall account,

At the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning the Pope began to laugh at this Ambaſſadour, and after waxed angrie, thinking that they had mocked him: but being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards aduertiſed of the ignorance of this Ambaſſadour, he moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked as well at the Prince which ſent him, as at the ſeruant which had ſhewed ſuch blockiſh groſſenes.

If this be true, the Prince committed a great error, to chuſe a groome of his chamber to treate of matters of eſtate and of conſequence: ſeeing that his office was to waite in the chamber, as the office of the ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to haue care for the table and other prouiſions for the houſe.

The wiſe man ſaith, if thou haue a good and faithfull ſeruant, loue him as thy ſoule, touching the which words, is to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtoode, that to know a good ſeruant, there <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> is no great difficultie, for the whole conſiſteth in this: he is called a good ſeruant, which loueth his Maſters profit better than his owne, which is alſo ſaid of a good ſeruant and officer of a Prince: but it is a very hard matter to finde one which loueth better ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans profit than his owne, principallie amongſt that kinde of people which get their liuing in other mens ſeruice; and truly that Maſter may holde himſelfe happie, whoſe hap is to meete with ſuch a ſeruant which loueth him better than himſelfe; and certainelie ſuch a ſeruant doth worthelie deſerue to be beloued of his Maſter,

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> as his owne life. But for as much as this kinde of men are ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie of condition and blood, baſe; by reaſon whereof they are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallie of a cowardly heart, I finde it not expedient to truſt to them, without firſt hauing good experience and proofe of their goodnes and ſidelitie, that a man may know, that they would more good to their Maſters, than to themſelues. I ſpeake not of that kinde of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants which are otherwiſe called ſlaues, for that a man may well finde ſlaues which are noble; neither of thoſe which voluntarilie follow ſome great Lord, and doe him ſeruice; but I ſpeake of thoſe, which conſtrained by neceſſitie,
<note place="margin">☞</note> hauing no occupation or arte to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> get their liuing, put themſelues to ſerue for wages and hire by the moneth, or otherwiſe: a man ought to proue the goodnes and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of ſuch men. This experience may bee had by meane of two things, which of cuſtome haue bin the ciment of all humane harts, (to wit) in giuing him the handling of money, and the gouernment of women: if he continue firme and conſtant in the gouernment of theſe two things, a man may know that he is a good and a loyall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant. In an officer and ſeruant of a Prince, beſides theſe ciments, I would ſay, that it were the ambition, affecting, or deſire of eſtate: but becauſe that that ſeldome happeneth, I will not ſpeake thereof: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> beſides this, that a Prince hauing truſted his honour, or imparted ſome great ſecret with his faithfull ſeruant, to whom afterwards he happily doth diſpleaſure, he hath no cauſe to bee afraid of him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able in a thouſand manners to defeate him: But ſtanding vpon the former concluſion, and ſpeaking of ordinarie ſeruants, I ſay that whoſoeuer doth reſolue to impart vnto him any ſecret, the reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling whereof importeth his life or his honor, he ought to reſolue and determine with himſelfe, neuer after to doe him any diſpleaſure. And my reaſon is this, That a man naturally is of a generous hart, &amp; can hardly endure diſpleaſures and iniuries; and there is no man, how baſe ſoeuer he bee, that taketh pleaſure to be deſpiſed and not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> accounted of, if hee be not ſome foole or ſome mad man. Preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe then, that the ſeruant be endued with good qualities and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and that his Maſter hath oftentimes had experience of his ſidelitie, I ſay neuertheleſſe, hee muſt alwaies hold him as a ſeruant, and not ſo much aſſure himſelf of him, that in communicating with him matters of importance, that of a Maſter hee become a ſeruant, and be to liue with ſo great reſpect of him, that he be conſtrained to endure ſome indignities, for that he knoweth that his ſeruant is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his ſecrets. Moreouer, when ſeruants ſee that they
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:13396:75"/>haue their foote vpon their Maſters throte, vſually they become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> and proud; and their pride is ſometime ſuch, that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to debate with their Maſter, and in a preſumptuous manner giue him word for word; and the poore Maſter fearing that the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant ſhould diſcouer his ſecret, muſt endure it, and oftentimes hold his peace, and yeeld vnto his ſeruant, as ouercome: and when at length, conſtrained by his mans inſolence, or his owne impatience, hee reſolueth to put him away, or to beate him with a cudgell, or to doe him ſome other diſpleaſure, although he haue deſerued it, he is forced to liue continually in feare, that his offended ſeruant will be reuenged of the diſpleaſure receiued, in reuealing the ſecret impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> vnto him, by reaſon whereof hee may loſe his honor or his life. In my time in Florence, there happened the like caſe; A citizen of Florence, either to reuenge the death of a kinſeman of the ſame houſe and familie, who by way of iuſtice had his head cut off, for ill managing the publike treaſure in exceſſiue expences, or for ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon which I could not vnderſtand, had a deſire to haue ſlaine <hi>Coſmo de Medicis,</hi> then great Duke of Tuſcane, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that hee had enioyed much good by him; and hauing neuer diſcouered this his thought to any man, but conſpired it with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe alone, at length he imparted this ſecret vnto one who was his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> ſeruant, who ſhot very well with a Harquebuze, and deſired him to make a ſhot at the Duke, when he ſhould be on hunting, lying alone in ſome buſh, as oftentimes he did. The ſeruant would not performe ſuch a treaſon; and in a while after ſome diſcord falling betweene the Maſter and the man, about a Iacke of Maile, and the ſeruant fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelfe grieued, left his Maſter and went to ſerue the Prouoſt of the field; who vpon a time asked of him how his old Maſter did vſe him: he anſwered, hee vſed me very ill, and if I would I could requite him that I could. In what manner couldeſt thou requite him, ſaid the Prouoſt? Then hee opened vnto him his Maſters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> requeſt, which he made vnto him to kill the Duke. Wherefore hee was taken, and deliuered into the hands of Iuſtice, and of the Magiſtrate of eight, and the trueth being diſcouered, he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to dye, and was executed: which hee peraduenture had eſcaped, if he had not reuealed his ſecret to his ſeruant; or after that he had diſcouered it, if hee had vſed him in ſuch ſort as he had had no occaſion to goe diſcontented from him, and then to diſcouer it.</p>

That this is no ſure way, a man may ſee by theſe reaſons. Firſt, that no man ought to put all his fortune in danger,
<note place="margin">It is follie to commit to the will of a few the ſtate of an Empire.</note> and not all his forces: for to doe ſo, is a manifeſt follie, as when a man putteth all his eſtate to the triall of a combat, of two or three, which, as arbitrators, are to determine and decide the controuerſie of that eſtate, as the Romanes and the Albanians

Secondly, becauſe that the paſſages are ſtreight, and mountainous, where many men of warre cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate themſelues, a man putteth in great danger the garriſon which he ſendeth thither: for the enemie encreaſing, may force the place, and by this meane part of the forces is loſt, and this loſſe, how little ſoeuer it be, cannot be but dangerous and preiudiciall; ſeeing that in ſuch places a man alwaies placeth valiant men. Thirdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the enemies comming is incertaine and vnknowne, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ſuch mountainous places, being barren, cold, and full of all vnreſt, the ſouldiers being ſent thither, vnable to ſtay there long, as well for the dearth of victuall, as for the difficultie to encampe and to lodge, ſhall be conſtrained to abandon them, and ſo you ſhal in vaine haue wearied and tired your ſouldiers, to their great diſcommoditie. In the fourth place, for as much as the mountaines are great, hauing diuers places to paſſe, the enemie may leaue the paſſages which are guarded, and paſſe by waies better knowne to the inhabitants, then to thoſe which hold the guards, and come downe without that any know how, or which way they came, as it happened to thoſe which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> truſting &amp; aſſuring themſelues that the Swiſſers, which were ſet and appointed to keepe the paſſage in the Alpes,

But it often commeth to paſſe, that whereas they ought to haue left the paſſage which was guarded, or loſing it by ſome occaſion, there is ſuch a feare and terror ſtriken into the harts of the people and ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, which truſted in that place, that being vnable to make expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of their valour, a man loſeth, or is in danger to loſe the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, as at that time it came to paſſe: for the Swiſſers would haue compounded with the King of France, whom they ſo much hated; Pope <hi>Leo,</hi> and the Viceroy of Naples, altered their opinions, and all

The errour afterwards, in not caring to know <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> the ſtate of the enemie, except it be by chance, or ſome vnexpected accident, happened to the Romanes when they had warres with the Equiens, in the which <hi>Sempronius</hi> being Conſul, and hauing his Armie oppoſit face to face againſt the Armie of the enemie, the battaile began betweene them, which continued vntill night, with variable fortune of either ſide. The night being come, and both Campes being in diſorder, neither of the Armies returned into their owne Campe, but each partie retired into the next moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, where they thought to be moſt aſſured; and the Romane Armie diuided it ſelfe into two parts, whereof the one went with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> the Conſul, and the other with <hi>Tempanius</hi> a Centurion: the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning being come, the Conſul (without knowing any thing of the affaires of the enemie) went to Rome, thinking that he had loſt the battaile; and the Equiens did the like, hauing both the one and the other left their Campes, to him that would, and thought himſelfe victorious.

But ſpeaking of other ſpies, they ought not to be made great or raiſed to honour, to diſhonour the dignitie of the Magiſtrate by their preſence, being vnlawfull that Gentlemen, which haue alwayes liued honourably, ſhould haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> ſuch a kind or manner of men for companions, but they may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, to the end that through the hope of profit, they may be the more vigilant and prompt to do their endeuour. Moreouer, that ſpies are very neceſſarie, for Generals and chiefe Commanders of Armies, they which mannage and gouerne them, know it well: for without them, hardly will it be knowne, as it is ſaid in the laſt Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the behauiour and practiſes of the enemie: and to ſay the trueth, it is impoſſble to know it. Wherefore wiſe Warriours haue vſed all meanes, to haue both tongue and eares, euen in the very Tent and

For this cauſe the old Marques of Peſcara,
<note place="margin">The opinion of the Marques of Peſcara.</note> wiſely iudged it to be a matter of great importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, to haue ſpies in the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Armie, and not to faile to entertaine them, with great kindnes, money and rewards: he did vſe to ſay, that things could not proue well to a Generall, if he tooke not paine and care by all endeuour and expence to haue in the enemies Armie many ſpies, to the end, that according to the behauiour and practiſes of the enemie, he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> might be reſolued to take all occaſions offered, which might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure victorie. It is true that they ought to take good heed in whom they truſt: for there are many which are double ſpies, which to get from the one and the other, make their affayres ill to proſper which repoſe truſt in them; and one double ſpie may doe more hurt and harme than ten faithfull and loyall doe good and profit to thoſe which employ them. Wherefore it is needfull that a Generall be well aduiſed, and know him well in whom he repoſe truſt, if he will not be deceiued. For this cauſe through aduenture,

                  <hi>Demaratus,</hi> which ſhould haue ſucceeded in the kingdome of the Lacedemonians, was depriued of that kingdome by <hi>Ariſton</hi> his father, for one onely word vttered without conſideration in the Senate, which was, that newes being brought vnto him that he had a ſonne borne, he counted vpon his fingers how long his wife had been with him, and ſeeing that there were no more but ſeuen mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:13396:84"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> and that vſually women are deliuered at nine, hee ſaid: It is not poſſible that hee ſhould be my ſonne. This word turned to the great dammage of <hi>Demaratus:</hi> for after the death of <hi>Ariſton</hi> his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Lacedemonians refuſed to giue him the kingdome,
<note place="margin">Herodot. lib. 6</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Ephores bare record, that <hi>Ariſton</hi> had ſaid, that it was not poſſible that <hi>Demaratus</hi> borne at ſeuen moneths end, ſhould be his ſonne, which he confirmed with an oth.</p>
               <p>When Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> the ſecond attempted to deliuer Italie from the <hi>Oltramontani,</hi> hee ſent an Italian Ambaſſadour to the King of England, to perſwade him to take armes in his behalfe againſt the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> King of France; and the Ambaſſadour hauing deliuered all that he had in charge to ſay, anſwere was giuen him in the behalfe of the King, that he was moſt readie and willing to defend the Pope, but that an Armie was not ſo ſoone to be made readie, for that the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, by reaſon of their long peace, had in a manner loſt the vſe of armes; and becauſethey were to goe againſt a King, who was no leſſe mightie and puiſſant, then warlike, as was the King of France, there ought to be a time to make neceſſarie prouiſion for a warre of ſo great importance. The Ambaſſadour preſently, to no purpoſe or reaſon, added theſe words: <hi>Anchio hodetto piu volte queſto medeſimo a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> ſua ſanctita:</hi> which is to ſay: And I haue oftentimes ſaid the ſame to his holines. Theſe words, which ſhewed the will of the Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour to be different from that of his Prince,
<note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of Pope</hi> Iulius <hi>was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a Spie by the King of England.</hi>
                  </note> gaue great doubt and ſuſpition to the Kings Counſell, and they began to doubt that the Ambaſſadour was rather inclined to fauour the King of France then the Pope his Maſter; and ſetting ſecret Spies about him, to take notice of his behauiour, it was perceiued that by night hee ſpake ſecretly with the French Ambaſſadour: by which meanes he was vndone, and if he had fallen into the hands of the Pope, he had peraduenture put him to death. And ſo by his anſwere, which was <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> not to the purpoſe of his charge, he wronged himſelfe, and was the occaſion that the King of England was conſtrained to begin the warre ſooner then hee would, who in deferring the ſuccours, had peraduenture accorded the controuerſie between the Pope and the French King.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Renzo de Ceri,</hi> a moſt honourable Captaine in his time, being in the pay and ſeruice of <hi>Laurence de Medicis</hi> in the warre which <hi>Francis Maria</hi> Duke of Vrbin made againſt him, to reconquer &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer his eſtate, was aduertiſed that certaine Spaniſh Captaines had
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:13396:85"/>plotted a treaſon to deliuer <hi>Francis Maria,</hi> into the hands of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> Duke of Florence. Wherefore the ſaid <hi>Renzo,</hi> talking with a Drumme, demaunded of him in ieſt and laughing, but with great inconſideration, When will theſe Spaniards deliuer your Duke priſoner? The Drumme made no anſwere: but being returned to the Campe, hee reported to <hi>Francis Maria,</hi> the words which <hi>Renzo</hi> had vſed vnto him, without any neceſſitie or reaſon. Wherefore the Duke of Vrbin hauing engrauen them in his heart, ſtood vpon his guard, and marked the behauiour of the Spaniſh Captaines. In the end, through certaine letters and writings found among their bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage,
<note place="margin">Certaine Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Captaines counict of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, were made to paſſe the pikes.</note> the truth appeared, and the conſpirators againſt Duke <hi>Francis</hi>

Thus <hi>Renzo</hi> was the cauſe why the treaſon tooke not effect, the Captaines were diſpatched, and <hi>Laurence</hi> his Maſter made not ſo ſoone an end of the warres, as otherwiſe peraduenture hee might haue done. And <hi>Guicciardin</hi> ſaith of <hi>Renzo,</hi> that hee was but ſhallow witted, to vſe ſuch ſpeeches to a Drumme, without any conſideration.</p>

               <p>We reade in the hiſtorie of the Greekes, and alſo in thoſe of Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, in the life of <hi>William</hi> the good, that <hi>Andronicus</hi> a Greeke fell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this inconuenience, who being left by <hi>Emanuell</hi> Emperour of Conſtantinople, Tutour of <hi>Aleſſus</hi> his ſonne: <hi>Andronicus</hi> aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> to the Empire by ſundrie deuices, draue away the Latines which fauoured the childe; and afterward as <hi>Aleſſus</hi> went in a little barke, to recreate himſelfe vpon the Sea, <hi>Andronious</hi> threw him into the water and drowned him, making the world to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue, that by miſchaunce he fell into the Sea, ſo as he was not able to ſaue him. But in the end the treaſon being diſcouered by the courſe which he held, putting many to death, and vniuſtly and without reaſon baniſhing others, the people of Conſtantinople pulled him in peeces.

And if hee ſhould then ſay, I ſhould neuer haue thought, that ſuch a man would haue betrayed me, he deſerued not to be blamed. As it happened vnto <hi>Lewes More</hi> Duke of Milan, who hauing committed the caſtle of Milan to the guard of one of his greateſt friends, and to whom he moſt truſted, and who was moſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> bound vnto him, becauſe of the great good, which he had beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vpon him, which was <hi>Bernardin Court,</hi> he was by him betrayed, to his perpetuall diſhonour and infamie.

Vpon this occaſion, if the Captaine of the Caſtle had ſaid, I would neuer haue thought that this ſhould haue befallen me, he had not deſerued to haue been reproued. But ſpeaking of thoſe which vndertake to doe <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> ſome enterpriſe, and haue time to be aduiſed, and to prouide for things neceſſarie, when through their fault they attaine not to what they deſired, or failing of their hopes, whereon their deſſeignes were grounded, or through want of ſight and order taken in all, as it behoued, I ſay that then, it ill beſeemeth a man to ſay, I thought not thereof. <hi>Federicque de Bezolo</hi> fell into this fault, when he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke the enterpriſe of Parma, in the yeare 1529. whereof <hi>Francis Guicciardin</hi> was gouernour generall for the Pope, after the death of <hi>Leo</hi> the tenth, (if the author for his owne praiſe make not the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter greater) for <hi>Federicque</hi> went thither without prouiſion of Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerie,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> ſauing two little Peeces, being ſetled vpon this imagination, that <hi>Guicciardin</hi> being inexperienced in the affaires of the warres, would not defend the Citie, and make his partie good againſt him. But this imagination deceiued him, and he being forced to retire from Parma, to his loſſe and diſhonour. He may ſay, (according as <hi>Guicciardin</hi> himſelfe hath written) that nothing had deceiued him in this enterpriſe (whereof he was the author) but that he had not thought that a gouernour, being no man of war, &amp; newly come to that Citie, would haue vndertaken the defence, and put himſelfe in danger after the death of the Pope, without hope of any profit, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> he might haue abandoned the charge, &amp; ſaued himſelfe with his honour. And laſtly he concludeth, that <hi>Federick de Bezzolo,</hi> let ſlip theſe words out of his mouth: I neuer thought that this man ſo conſtantly would haue vndertaken this defence: which words tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were not worthie of ſo renowned and noble a Captaine, as <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick</hi> was, in that time: for that hee ought to beleeue that valour of courage is ſometimes found in men contrarie to all expectation, and neceſſitie doth often make men to do thoſe things, which they would neuer haue attempted of themſelues, by their owne choiſe,

Wherefore when a Generall gouerneth himſelfe with conſideration, and ſheweth that hee ſo much eſteemeth the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies valour, that he will not hazard raſhly to aſſault him, neither with ſhame and puſillanimitie to flie from him, he doth well, &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> himſelfe knowne to bee wiſe and of iudgement. But to the contrary, when he ſheweth to make ſuch account of him, &amp; to haue ſuch diſtruſt in his owne forces, that he dareth not attempt to ſound him, hee ſhall neuer be able to doe any thing of worth, and in vaine ſhall ſpend his time, and the charge which he muſt be at: and the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue of the warre ſhall be diſhonorable vnto him, and dammageable to his Prince. This is perceiued betweene two priuate enemies, when the one in his heart conceiueth a great opinion of the valour and courage of the other, and diſtruſteth himſelfe, either becauſe he wanteth courage, or knoweth not how to handle his weapons: this
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:13396:93"/>conceit maketh him ſo fearefull, that he eſcheweth all occaſions to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> enter into any quarrell againſt him, and to fight with him. Wee ſee the like in open warres, that when one armie too much eſteemeth and is afraid of the other, it doth nothing elſe but retire, and turne to this place, or that place, encampe in ſome ſtrong place, and make delaies; ſo as wanting courage to aſſaile the enemie, without making any proofe and experiment whether they had reaſon to feare or no. <hi>Francis Maria</hi> Duke of Vrbin, being Generall for the Venetians, and the League, after the deliuerie of the French King, was to go to relieue and ſet at libertie <hi>Francis Sforce,</hi> who was beſieged in the Caſtle of Milan: being come to the Citie, he conceiued ſuch an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> of the Spaniſh and Almaine ſouldiers which beſieged the Caſtle, and had ſo ſmall confidence in his own Armie, that he eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it vile: ſo that although there were therein many old ſouldiers, and famous Captaines of Italie; yet he tooke a conceit in his mind, that he would not charge them, without ſome mightie ſquadron of Swiſſers: and going to Milan for this enterpriſe, to deliuer the Duke and the Caſtle, he loſt ſo much time in attending the Swiſſers, that he gaue leaue, meanes and leiſure to the Duke of Bourbon, to enter into Milan with a garriſon and forces of other Spaniſh troupes, and his hope was loſt, and the foundation laid on the people of Milan.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> And ſo many other occaſions ſeruing fit for his purpoſe to haue ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected his deſſeignes, and to haue preuailed in this enterpriſe, eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped out of his hands: and in the end with this delaying and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing his Campe from place to place, attending the comming of the Swiſſers, he went to the gates of Milan, thinking to haue found no reſiſtance: but at the firſt charge hee found himſelfe deceiued, for the Spaniards well defended the port towards Rome, which he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted, and ſlew fortie of his men, and wounded many; and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending the Suburbes was done the like. Wherefore the Duke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more confirmed in his opinion of the valour of the enemie, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> the cowardiſe of his Italian ſouldiers,
<note place="margin">Guicci. lib. 17.</note> hee ſuddenly determined to withdraw himſelfe from Milan with his Armie: and ſo the ſame night he gaue the Popes Lieutenant and the Pourueiour of the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians to vnderſtand of his determination, and how that hee had alreadie begun to put it in execution, perſwading them to doe the like: and ſo going to incamp himſelfe at Marignan, he reſolued not to depart from thence vntill his ſuccours of twelue thouſand Swiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers ſhould be come, iudging it impoſſible to obtaine the victorie, without two armies; whereof each of them apart, had beene ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> to haue withſtoode and reſiſted the enemies, vnited altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. And although the chiefe Commanders of the Armie of the League were diſcontent with this departure, and were of diuers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions of this his ſudden reſolution, in the end it was thought that the Duke did it for no other cauſe, then for that he was returned to his firſt opinion, by the which he ſtood in greater doubt of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the enemie, and did more diſtruſt the valour of the Italian ſouldiers, then all the reſt of the Captaines and Commanders did. And among others the Lord <hi>Iohn de Medicis,</hi> who commaunded the Arriergard with the Popes Infantrie, would neuer retire vntill <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> it was light day, ſaying, that in ſtead of victorie he would not beare the ſhame and diſhonour to runne away by night. That the Dukes feare, and his ſudden determination were without any foundation, experience, and the iſſue of the affaires doe plainly make manifeſt: for there was none of the Emperors armie that ſallied out to charge the Arriergard and taile of the armie: and when it was day, the Spaniards themſelues did marueile at their ſudden diſorderly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traite. A Captaine then ought not ſo to drowne himſelfe in his own conceit, and iudgement of the valour and cowardiſe of others, if firſt hee haue not made (and that more then once) ſome notable <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> triall: for to ſettle an opinion, and to beleeue that it is ſo, maketh a man fearefull, and when the Lion which leadeth the Harts, ſhall ſeeme to be afraid, hee ſhall neuer make the Harts become Lions: and when the Generall ſhall ſhew himſelfe diſmaied, the ſouldiers will likewiſe be out of heart. I thinke the Duke of Vrbin did it not without ripe iudgement, and it might ſo be that he knew the Duke of Bourbons entrie into Milan, which was very ſecret, and was not peraduenture knowne to the reſt, and that he ſaw many difficulties to remaine there, knowne to himſelfe onely, and therefore choſe this manner of retraite, for that he would not engage his Armie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> vnable to ſuccour the Duke of Milan. And being a moſt noble Prince, and in that time eſteemed the moſt wiſe Captaine that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the warres, and reputed the chiefe Captaine of all Italie, as in truth he was, it is not to be beleeued that hee would haue retired ſo without ſome great reaſon, which hee alone did vnderſtand, well knowing alſo that this retraite would be accounted little to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</p>

And whether it be either Prince or Common-wealth <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> that be reduced to this point, to be ingratefull to thoſe, who valiantly and faithfully haue ſerued them, a man may ſay that they are fallen blinde, and that not onely they haue ſmall care of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, but that they perceiue not, that they incurre great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, which are of importance. This ingratitude of cuſtome riſeth through many occaſions, among which this is one, that a man knowing ſometime that he hath receiued a great pleaſure, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſufficiently recompence it, he reſolueth to pay it with ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. But ſpeaking to the purpoſe, I ſay, that a Prince which giueth occaſion to his Captaines to forſake him (after that they haue well <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> and truly ſerued him) and to goe oftentimes to the ſeruice of his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, beſides the ſpot and ſtaine of ingratitude, he incurreth the diſhonour and blame of auarice; and it is to be deemed that the ſame proceedeth from the inconſideration of him, who is now e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped out of the neceſſitie and danger wherein he was, who thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth that he ſhall neuer returne and reenter into the ſame againe. Of this condition are thoſe, who hauing had a Generall or other chiefe and valorous conductor, in their ſeruice in the warres, for the leaſt occaſion that may happen, eſtrange themſelues vnto them,

This manner of proceeding is very dangerous, and draweth after it many euils, which afterwards proue remedileſſe, for a man can giue no greater ioy to an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie than this, to wit, to giue him meanes to draw from him men that are valiant and faithfull, and to bring them to his ſeruice: for this cauſe the ſayings of <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> vſed to <hi>Themistocles</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenian, who was baniſhed by his Citizens, and comming to ſee <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> him, were much commended, I cannot (ſaid he) deſire a greater euill to mine enemies, than that being blinded with auarice or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, they be depriued of the valour and prudence of ſuch men, and eſtrange themſelues from them. <hi>Alberigue de Barbian,</hi> a man of great valour and reputation in the warres in his time, committed this error, hee hauing ſubdued the Bouloignois, through the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſſe and valour of <hi>Braccio de Monton,</hi> which he acknowledged with many ſignes of curteſie and good will, commending him publikelie, and increaſed his pay and his charge, gaue him the armes and enſignes of his houſe, and finallie the gouernment of the whole <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> Armie.

And there are ſome ſo conſtant in this conceit, that, to the end that they would not liue in this manner, but bee free from this feare and ſuſpition, loue better to rebell againe, then ciuilly to take the benefit of their Princes fauour and clemencie: of which num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> there were certaine Florentine gentlemen, in the time of the warres of Siena, which being recalled to their countrie by Duke <hi>Coſmo,</hi> and ſo conſequently were receiued with great curteſie into grace and fauour: ſome accepted the returne, and promiſed to raiſe companies; but afterwards moued with this feare, and diſtruſting that promiſe ſhould not bee held with them, reſolued with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues to ſtay abroad, and ſerue thoſe which rebelled againſt their countrie: and ſome there were which did ſerue in that warre, and hauing obtained the victory, euen then, when they ſhould haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured to haue maintained themſelues in the fauour of this moſt

Wherefore as a wiſe Captaine ought not to be prouoked by the ill words and reproches comming from his enemies, to doe any thing againſt reaſon; ſo ought he to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beare to ſpeake ill himſelfe, and that his Souldiers iniure not the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> abroade, neither vſe any outragious ſpeeches among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues within; for that may prouoke the enemie, and vrge him to ſeeke reuenge, and this may alſo breed a confuſion in an armie.

Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth, a man in our time whoſe good and vertuous life was ſuch, as the world knoweth, yet could he not auoide euill ſpeeches and blame; for at the beginning of his Papacie, there was a diffamato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie libell againſt him, faſtened and ſet vpon <hi>Paſquin,</hi> as in that time the abuſe at Rome then was, to ſpeake ill in this manner, and to raile againſt the liues of all the Princes in Chriſtendome.

Wherefore a man ought to conſider many things, when he feeleth himſelfe wrongfully diffamed: for hee ought to conſider who it is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that hath ſlandered him; if he be a man of an euill qualitie, and baſe condition, and reputed for a lier and a backbiter, then he ought not to regard it, for his malice will diſcouer it ſelfe, and he which hath miſſpoken and vſed euill ſpeeches, ſhall remaine toucht therewith in his reputation, and hee to the contrarie whoſe credit and eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he would haue ſtained and obſcured, ſhall be the more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and eſteemed. Secondly, hee ought to conſider, if (of the blame and accuſation laid wrongfully to his charge) hee ſhall be tried and iuſtified by iuſt and indifferent perſons, or ſuch as are rigorous, rude, cruell, and paſſionate. If hee haue to deale with honeſt men
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:13396:114"/>and of good conſcience, let him freely enter into any place to cleere <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> himſelfe: for if the Iudge will not bee corrupted by reaſon of his ſinceritie and goodnes, although that he ſhall ſuffer for a time; yet at length, with his honour, and proofe of his innocencie, he ſhall be deliuered: for God helpeth the iuſt, and aſſiſteth him which is wrongfully accuſed. But if thoſe (by which thou art to be tried) be wicked, malitious, and eaſie to bee wonne and corrupted, put not thy ſelfe into their hands, but flye (if thou canſt) to auoide their iudgement: for it were better that a man by flight ſhould bee held in ſome ſuſpition of the fault imputed vnto him, then that he ſhould put himſelfe into the hands of a beaſt, who by his rude brutalitie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> may bring him to an euill and vnworthie end, and to ſatisfie either his owne or another mans rage, may vſe a man miſerably: for in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending and giuing time, to time, the truth commeth to be knowne, and in the end innocencie will manifeſt it ſelfe, euen of it ſelfe. Let him finally beware to ſtand to bee tried vpon vncertaine proofes and meanes which may come, or not come, to effect: for that might well bee attributed to raſhnes, as hee alſo might well be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led raſh, who by ſuch manner proofes would binde himſelfe to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that which hee ſaith to bee true, although that it were moſt falſe and malitiouſly forged: let him then (I ſay) that is accuſed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> ſtand ſo on his guard, that hee ſuffer not himſelfe to bee brought to make ſuch proofes and experiences; as to vndertake the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, ſeeing that by the combat a man cannot come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the trueth, but may remaine diſhonoured, being neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe moſt innocent and wrongfully accuſed. And to the end that it may be the better vnderſtood, I will propound this example hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the citie of Spoletta. There was in that Citie a yong man, who was robbed of a good ſumme of money, and imagining and firmely beleeuing that another young man had robbed him, began to accuſe him and call him theefe: and becauſe he could not make <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> proofe of his ſpeeches, he ſpread a report abroad that he would iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie it with his ſword in his hand (ſeeing that there was no other meane) that hee had robbed him, and that that which he ſaid was true. The young man accuſed of the theft, and innocent of the fact, was aduertiſed of what the other reported of him, and how that hee auouched that hee would prooue it vpon him with his ſword, that hee was a theefe; beeing mooued with deſpite and with the intereſt and preiudice of his honour and reputation, hee accepted, to prooue his innocencie (which hee held for moſt

Wherefore they came to blowes in their ſhirts, with their rapiers and poyniards in their hands; and in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat the innocent man was ſlaine and diſhonoured, and the accuſer remaining victorious, was held to haue ſaid the truth. Some ſpace after the trueth of the matter was diſcouered, and the theefe was found: ſo as it was knowne and did appeare, that that man tooke a raſh and an vnaduiſed reſolution, who would ſhew his innocencie by the triall of a combat: for in ſuch fights and combats is found <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> neither reaſon nor iudgement, ſeeing that choler, valour, fortune and wit, haue therein the rule. And I ſay that <hi>Ariosto</hi> (if it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to mixe graue matters with fables) hath very elegantly depain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this furious and raſh iudgement in the perſon of <hi>Mandricard,</hi> when hee vniuſtly accuſeth King <hi>Gradaſſe</hi> to haue ſtolen <hi>Rolands</hi> ſword. Wherefore let euery man be well aduiſed, how he too raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put himſelfe vpon vncertaine proofes, where hee may as well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue diſhonour, as diſcharge of the crime imputed vnto him.

               <p>A man may alſo for example bring in the fault which the Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines committed in the time that Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the 7. made wars againſt them, which was this: They choſe <hi>Malatesta Baglioni</hi> for their General,
<note place="margin">Guicci. lib. 20.</note> and put themſelues in armes for thier defence againſt
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:13396:118"/>the Popes and the Emperours Armies: and hauing ſuſtained and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> valiantly endured the ſiege for the ſpace of eleuen moneths, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing conſumed their victuals, and being no longer able to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, all aide and ſuccours failing them, their Generall and the Lord <hi>Stephen Columna,</hi> aduiſed them to ſee if they could come to ſome agreement with the Emperour and the Pope, by ſome good compoſition. But <hi>Raphael Girolami,</hi> which was Standerd-bearer, with many other citizens of his faction, being moued againſt <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateſta,</hi> without conſideration of the daunger wherein the citie was, and that the Generall was armed, and had a good corps de guard of ſouldiers, Peruſins, and other Nations at his ſeruice and commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> they ſent <hi>Andrew Nicolini,</hi> and <hi>Francis Zati</hi> as Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours to <hi>Malateſta,</hi> to diſcharge him, and to depriue him of his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and charge of Generall; which was concluded in their Common councell. <hi>Malateſta</hi> was very angrie, and ſetting hand to his poyniard, fell vpon <hi>Nicolini,</hi> and once ſtabd him, and would haue ſlaine him, but for thoſe which ſtood by, who prayed him to hold his hands. Hereupon the Citie mutined, and euery man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke him to his weapons. Wherefore <hi>Malateſta</hi> fearing ſome great hurlie burlie, preſently ſent the Captaine <hi>Margute</hi> of Peruſa, to ſeize on the port of S. Peter Gatolini, which is the gate towards Rome,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> and gaue him charge to prime the Ordnance, and to bend it againſt the Citie, to be able to defend himſelfe againſt the Citizens, if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture they ſought to offend him,
<note place="margin">A dangerous tumult happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.</note> and cauſed to come to him all the ſouldiers ſtrangers which he had in Florence. If the enemie at that time had giuen aſſault vnto the Citie, being then diſunited from their Generall, it might eaſily haue been taken and ſackt, as well by thoſe which were within, as by thoſe which were without, both which at one inſtant would haue been become enemies. And ſo through the little wit and ſmall diſcretion of the Magiſtrates, the ſafetie of their Citie and countrie was ſet (as a man might ſay) vpon <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> the point of a needle. Generals then and Colonels are not to bee grieued and touched in honour; and it were much better to reſolue to puniſh them, when they commit any notable faults, (as many Potentates haue done) then by interreſſing their honors, to hazard the affaires and enterprizes in queſtion, as may bee well perceiued by the two examples aboue alleaged.</p>

And <hi>Plato</hi> was no other at Syracuſa, then he was wont to bee at Athens, and with <hi>Dion</hi> and <hi>Dionyſius</hi> hee was the ſame. It importeth much to know the manners and faſhions of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> a nation, which among them are generally accounted and taken for good, and to aſſay and practiſe to conforme himſelfe thereto, and ſometimes to be apparelled, as they are, with whom a man conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and to inuite them to dine and eate with them, and to vſe ſuch faſhions as they vſe among themſelues, when there ſhal be occaſion to treate of affaires.

A man muſt not eſchue the companie and conuerſation of gentlemen as baſe, for it is better to beare with ſome thing, then to ſeeme to abhorre it: and briefly, wee are to behaue our ſelues ſo towards all, as that we may get the fauour and good will of all: for he that will liue only after the manner of his owne countrie, may peraduenture be mockt for his labour, becauſe that faſhions and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes are not euery where alike: for a man behaueth himſelfe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one manner in Itatly, and after another in France, and in France the faſhions are different from thoſe of Spaine. Wherfore he which will liue in Italy as an Italian, in France as a Frenchman, and in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Spaine after the manner of Spaine, ſhall euer better diſpatch his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſines the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> another. And for this cauſe I much eſteem of thoſe which being to trauell into diuers countries, learne diuers languages: for thereby they ſhall be the better vnderſtood in expreſſing their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and conceits, in that countrie ſpeech where they are, then they ſhall doe in their owne tongue: and he which ſhall goe Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour into Spaine, and follow the Court, being an Italian, ſhall euer haue better acceſſe to the King, and more fauour of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors and Secretaries, hauing the Spaniſh tongue, then if hee ſpake no other but onely Italian: for beſides that he ſhall neuer haue need

In the time of Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> the fourth, the Cardinall of Aquileia had this conſideration, being ſent by the Pope as Legate, to <hi>Alfonſo</hi> K. of Arragon and of Naples, to treate of peace betweene them: but becauſe the Cardinall had not the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh tongue, neither was well able to expreſſe his minde in the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, in ſuch ſort as the King might well vnderſtand him, neither an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to the Kings demaunds ſo well as to content him, hee reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to ſerue his turne, by the meanes of a Prothonotarie, which he had with him, whoſe name alſo was <hi>Alfonſo,</hi> who ſpeaking in Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> to the King, and ſhewing the will and charge of the Legate, ſo as he was vnderſtood, concluded and confirmed the peace; which had not peraduenture been concluded by the Legate, which had not that tongue, neither knew how to vtter his ſpeeches with ſuch efficacie as they might haue been vnderſtood. Thoſe alſo which by good fortune are called to the gouernment of kingdomes and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reine eſtates, to winne the fauour of the people ought alſo to liue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the cuſtome of the countrie whither they are called, and not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that of the countrey where they were bred vp: into which error fell <hi>Vnon</hi> King of the Parthians, which being brought young to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> Rome, was bred vp and taught there, and learned very well the manners and faſhions of the Romanes.

Wherefore I haue euer diſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked thoſe Lords, which haue about them ieſters and dwarfs, or ſuch like traine of moſt baſe condition, who receiuing ſome honourable Gentleman ſtranger into their houſes, permit that thoſe either in word or deed, ſay, or doe them any iniurie, couering the diſhoneſty of the ſpeech or fact, with this leane excuſe, that the iniurie was done by a foole: where the fooles themſelues not diſcerning the qualitie of men, thinke that all men are of like condition, which is falſe: for our humors are not all of one kinde, and ſome one man is pleaſed and delighteth in thoſe toyes, and another hateth them. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> And I remember that a filthie dwarfe, very ſhameleſſe and vnman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerly in diſcourſe (as the moſt part of ſuch vermine vſe to be) was likely to haue been throwne by a noble perſonage out at a Palace window, where hee was lodged; and although that this Lorde, through great intreatie, did not throwe the dwarfe out at the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes, yet he preſently made ſigne to his ſeruants and departed from this pallace, and went to lye in a religious cloyſter, much bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming him that had intertained him; not that he was any way offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or iniured through the Maſters fault of the houſe, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he kept ſuch raſcally ſcumme in his houſe, which knew no
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:13396:121"/>difference betweene man and man, but vſed al alike. Hoſpitalitie is a <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> vertue worthy a gentleman and a chriſtian, but when it is violated it is changed into a palce of robberie: ſo as that lodging, which by the law of hoſpitalitie was holie, becommeth a wood, and a lurking place and ill aſſured: and a ſtranger may ſay, being iniuried, that he found more ſecuritie in forreſts, then in houſes; and more curteſie among beaſts, then among men. From whence proceeded the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall infamie and diſhonour to <hi>Procuſt</hi> and <hi>Sciron,</hi> ſlaine by <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeus,</hi> but from the cruelty which they vſed towards ſtrangers, which fell into their hands? For as <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaith, the one had a bed, where he lodged al the gueſts which he brought into his houſe; and if the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> man were longer then the bed, he cut off his legs; &amp; if he were ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he ſtretched him ſo out in length, that he fitted him to the bed: and the other, bending downe the boughes of trees to the ground, wherto he tied his gueſts by the members, &amp; then cutting the cords wherewith the boughes were faſtened to the earth, took great plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to ſee a man diſme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bred in this manner. Wherfore the Prophet in the Pſalmes ſaid: <hi>Dominus cuſtodiet aduenas, pupillum &amp; viduam ſuſcipiet, &amp; vias peccatorum diſperdet.</hi> As if hee would ſay, there are three ſorts of people in the world preſerued by the Lord, and are as in his ſafeguard: to wit, Strangers, Orphanes, and Widowes. That <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> God defendeth and keepeth ſtrangers, we haue examples in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Scriptures;
<note place="margin">Particular perſons preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of God.</note> for where mans wiſedome could not defend them, the ſecret iudgement of God hath ſupplied it. <hi>Abraham</hi> was a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in Egypt, and feared that the beautie of his wife would bee an occaſion of diſhonour vnto her, and of hurt vnto him; and ſo, as a man, he ſought humane meanes: and although that hee would not tell a lye, yet he ſought neuertheleſſe to conceale one truth in allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging another, willing her to ſay that ſhe was his ſiſter, and conceale that ſhe was his wife: but in that that God taketh care and charge of ſtrangers, <hi>Abraham</hi> was miraculouſly deliuered, but not by his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> owne wiſedome, and with his honor &amp; life ſaued, he performed the voyage he had begun. Wherefore ſaith the Prophet, that God ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth care for ſtrangers? Hath he not care for all? doth he not regard all? doth he not beſtow his benefits vpon all, as well euill as good? doth he not deſire that all ſhould be ſaued? doth he not call all vnto him? and finally, is not he the vniuerſall father of all, that euer were, are, or ſhall be? Wherefore then doth he ſay, that hee careth for the ſtrangers, and protecteth the orphanes and widowes? becauſe that there are none in the world, which haue more neede of helpe then
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:13396:121"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> theſe three. The ſtranger hath neede of ſome bodie to ſet him in the right way; the pupill, of ſome one to protect him, and preſerue what is his; and the widow, of ſome one to defend her from the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of thoſe which are too mightie for her. The ſtranger hath need of one to defend him from iniuries; the pupill hath neede of one to aſſure and defend him, againſt him which pretendeth right to his inheritance; and the widow hath neede of one, to keepe and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue her from him which would deceiue her. The ſtranger hath neede of one to lodge him in curteſie in his houſe; the pupill of one who may keepe him neere about him, as his childe; and the widow <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> of him who may preſerue her pudicitie, and to keepe her good name. Among which three degrees of perſons preſerued of God, hee firſt nameth the ſtranger, becauſe that hee is more forſaken then the reſt: for the pupill hath his tutors, and the widow her kindred. For this cauſe God preſerued innocent <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> being ſold to the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maelites, and made young <hi>Tobias</hi> to be accompanied by an Angell, being to goe into a ſtrange countrie. Yea the ſame Prophet reciting the miſdeedes and wickednes of the vniuſt, and praying to God to behold them with the eye of his iuſtice, among other things ſaith thus; <hi>Viduam &amp; aduenam interfecerunt, &amp; pupillos occiderunt:</hi> They <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> haue murthered the widow and the ſtranger, and haue put the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pils to death: for as there are none found in the world more humble, more ſubiect to iniuries, and more vnworthie to bee grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and wronged, then the ſtranger, the widow, and the pupill: ſo a man cannot imagine a greater villanie, then that which is done to one of thoſe. The faults which a man wittingly committeth againſt his friends are great: but thoſe which are committed againſt ſtraun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, are moſt great in this, that hauing neither friends, nor parents, which may ſupport and defend their right; any man that wrongeth them, ſheweth himſelfe to bee moſt baſe and puſillanimous, ſeeing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> that a generous heart can neuer be induced to doe wrong or iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to one that is leſſe then himſelfe. For which cauſe there haue bin many, which haue choſen to bee rather wronged in their honour, then to ſuffer ſtrangers to bee diſhonoured in their houſes: and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue rather ſuffered violence in their bodies, then that thoſe which they had receiued and lodged in their houſes ſhould indure any abuſe. Others haue better loued to obſerue inuiolably the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of hoſpitalitie, then to gaine the friendſhip of an Empire: and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers haue preferred the gentle entertainment of ſtrangers, before the deliuerie of their country from tyrannie. We reade in the booke
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:13396:122"/>of Iudges in the 19. chapter, that an old Gabaonite lodged a young <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Leuite in his houſe, and ſeeing that certaine impudent young men of Gabaa, would doe wrong vnto this Leuite, who had a moſt faire wife; the old man went forth and offered them his daughter, to the end they ſhould not grieue the Leuite: but the Leuite would not ſuffer that his hoſt, who had curteouſly lodged him, ſhould be tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched and grieued in honour, but hee abandoned his wife to their vnbridled rage: and after this execrable fact, hee followed the rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and memorable vengeance againſt the Gabaonites. And ſo a man may ſee that the old Gabaonite was readie to ſuffer that his owne daughter ſhould rather be diſhonoured, then endure that the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> Leuite lodged in his houſe ſhould receiue any iniurie.</p>
               <p>In the time of <hi>Totila, Cerbon,</hi> a man of holie life, was Biſhop of a Citie in Tuſcane, called Popolongna: this man loued better to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure death and to be ſlaine by <hi>Totila,</hi> then to diſcouer certain ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers which he had lodged in his houſe. He ſuffered himſelfe to bee throwne by this Tyrant and giuen to Beares, to the end that they ſhould haue deuoured him, rather then to ſuffer that thoſe which he had hidden ſhould fall into the hands of him who was more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged and cruell then a Beare. But <hi>Totila</hi> ſeeing that thoſe cruell beaſts did not hurt him, notwithſtanding that he was in the midſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> them, was aſhamed to take life from him, to whom the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage beaſts would doe no harme, and let him goe.</p>
               <p>After the battaile of Cannas, wherein <hi>Hanniball</hi> defeated the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane armie with two Conſuls, <hi>Hanniball</hi> retired with victorie to Capua, and was lodged by a gentleman of Capua in his houſe. This gentlemans ſonne named <hi>Perolla,</hi> much affected to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes, had a deſire to kill <hi>Hanniball:</hi> but his father would not ſuffer him to doe it, not permitting him to kill ſo great a Captaine in his owne houſe. And among many reaſons which <hi>Titus Liuius</hi> bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the father of this young man, ſpeaking to his ſonne, diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> him from killing <hi>Hanniball,</hi> hee produceth him, among the moſt liuely and effectuall, ſaying: That hee ſhould not ſoyle his hands in the blood of a ſtranger, nor ſtaine and defile his table of hoſpitalitie, where <hi>Hanniball</hi> had in ſaftie drunke and eaten.</p>
               <p>The Romanes had warres againſt <hi>Phillip</hi> of Macedon, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to draw the Etolians vnto their partie, and to bring <hi>Phillip</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diſgrace with them; as the Romane Oratours ſpake to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of the Etolians, among other matters, they alleaged and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched vnto <hi>Phillip,</hi> the homicide &amp; murther of a ſtranger, whom
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:13396:122"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> he lodging in his houſe had cauſed to be ſlaine. Wherein it is to be ſeene, that the outrage done to ſtrangers, is imputed vnto men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong moſt odious villanies. <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> in the fifteenth booke of his hiſtories ſaith, that at Rome was a conſpiracie againſt <hi>Nero,</hi> wherein were many participants, to wit, Senatours, ſundrie of the Order of Knighthood, many ſouldiers, and ſome women: all theſe conſpired together to kill <hi>Nero,</hi> being vnable to endure his ſo great and many villanies and tyrannies: the conſpiracie came to this point, that there wanted nothing, but to finde a place fit to put it in execution. The conſpiratours conſulted together of the time and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> place: one would haue him killed in the Citie and Theater while he was ſinging; or that a houſe ſhould be ſet on fire, and while hee ranne thither without guard, a man might haue oportunitie to kill him. Another would haue him killed in the fieldes, another in the Palace: one was of opinion to haue him killed in the Temple: one named one place, another another. In fine, they reſolued to execute this enterpriſe in the houſe of a certaine man called <hi>Caius Piſo,</hi> who was one of the conſpiratours, a man who for his good qualities and vertues, was wiſhed to haue been choſen to the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall dignitie. <hi>Piſo</hi> had his houſe and farme at Baya, whither <hi>Nero</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> of cuſtome did vſe to walke to paſſe the time, and ſtayed there moſt commonly without guard, and without weapons, as in a place moſt ſecure. <hi>Piſo</hi> would not conſent thereto, ſaying, that hee would not defile his houſe with the blood of any Prince whatſoeuer he were, neither his table of hoſpitalitie, and receiuing of gueſts, whither the Emperour came with aſſurance and truſt; adding further, that as often as <hi>Nero</hi> came into his houſe, he receiued him as a ſtranger, and not as a Prince. <hi>Lorenzin de Medicis</hi> had not that conſideration and reſpect, (notwithſtanding his good affection to <hi>Cornelius Taci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi>) when he ſlew <hi>Alexander de Medicis</hi> Duke of Florence: for he <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> regarded not that he was in his houſe, and vpon his bed, whither <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> vſed to goe, with great aſſurance: neither whether he were in his houſe as a gueſt, or as a kinſman, or as a Duke: for hee as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute conſpiratour had determined to kill him, where ſoeuer hee might finde oportunitie thereto: by reaſon whereof he peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deſerued no leſſe blame for hauing quelled him in his houſe, where hee held himſelfe for very aſſured, being lodged and aſleepe vpon his bed, then to haue ſlaine a man after whoſe death enſued not any thing of that which he had proiected. But <hi>Piſo</hi> would haue hoſpitalitie and curteſie towards ſtrangers held in ſuch reuerence, as
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:13396:123"/>in ancient time was vſed, which was, holie, free, and venerable, euen <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> as they held for holie, free and venerable the publike faith, which it was not lawfull to violate. And although that a man with iuſt cauſe were angrie and diſpleaſed with another man, yet ſo often as he ſhal come where hee may haue his will of him, put himſelfe into his hands, enter into his houſe and lie in his bed, all wrath and hatred ought to bee laid aſide, and to conſider how much importeth the blame to haue violated hoſpitalitie &amp; receiuing of ſtrangers, which is alwaies greater, then any other commoditie or contentment, which may poſſiblie happen by breaking and violating the ſame.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> treaſon may be tearmed reuenge, but ingratitude can haue no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name, neither can be couered or ſhadowed by any meanes, but continuing euer naked and manifeſt, is conſtrained to ſhew it ſelfe euery where with ſhame and diſhonour.</p>
               <p>There be three degrees of ingratitude, the firſt is, not to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe and requite a pleaſure receiued: the ſecond, to forget it one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: the third to render euill for good. The firſt is euill, the ſecond is worſe, and the third is worſt of all: the firſt may be ſometimes at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the impoſſibilitie; the other to negligence; but the third is euer attributed to malignitie. Not to recompence in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> ſome ſort, may bee excuſed; to forget a pleaſure is hardly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable; but to render euill for good, can bee excuſed in no ſort whatſoeuer. And as thoſe are the moſt wicked men in the world, which vſe and abuſe the gifts of God, to the ende to ſinne as rich men, which become couetous; ſound and healthie men, luxurious, incontinent and inſolent; ſtrong and able men, full of violence; ingenious and wittie men, which become deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and fraudulent: euen ſo the ingratefull are more worthie of blame, which turne and conuert the benefites and pleaſures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, to the hurt and diſhonour of the benefactor. An ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> man ought to bee ſhunned as the plague; for a man cannot finde a more peſtilent and pernicious thing then him, which euer thinketh, ſpeaketh, or doeth euill, and louing only himſelfe, hateth euerie man els, and principallie thoſe which doe good to the good; hee doubteth not to execute any kinde of wickedneſſe, and may well be ſaid, to be the ſinke of all villanie; ſo as a man may be aſſured that the only good which he can doe, is to die onlie, for thereby he ſhall purge and cleare the world from his infection, and the earth doth recouer and hide the horrible monſter, which it bred <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> of all men, yet it ſeemeth that it is little eſteemed now adayes: for the number of ingratefull men, is ſo increaſed, that of force wee muſt beare with this imperfection, as wee doe with many others; which commeth of no other thing, but becauſe that this vice by our lawes, can receiue no puniſhment which may equall it. And men ordinarilie now care leſſe for words then for deeds. Wherefore as paines and puniſhments are ordeined for theeues, murtherers, and rebels to Princes, and diſturbers of the common peace; ſo I would to God alſo, that torments were preſcribed for ingratefull men; there would not peraduenture then be ſo many, and men would be
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:13396:124"/>more afraide to ſhew themſelues to be ingratefull, and without cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> towards their benefactors. The Egyptians gaue this puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to thoſe which were ingratefull to their father or mother, which was, that they made the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be gelded, to the end they ſhould not beget any ſuch as they were, and be perpetually depriued of the hope and pleaſure to haue children; iudging that puniſhment to be conformable to the fault, and that hee which was ingratefull to his father, did not deſerue to be a father. As for thoſe which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratefull to their friendes, they cauſed them to be proclaimed and publiſhed euery where, for infamous; to the end that no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhould euer doe them anie pleaſure, eſteeming it a puniſhment fit for him <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> which had beene ingratefull to a friend, to bee made to loſe all his friendes. <hi>Zenophon</hi> in the life of <hi>Cyrus</hi> ſaith, that among the Perſians, no vice was more blamed then ingratitude: and they ſeuerely pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed him, that was able to requite a pleaſure, if he did not recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence it; for they iudged an ingratefull man, to be a contemner of the gods, to haue no reſpect to his Parents, loue to his countrie, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther care of his friends. Ingratitude ordinarily is a friend and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion to contempt and ſhameleſnes or impudencie: and <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras</hi> ſhewed well, that ingratefull men were to be baniſhed from the countrie, when he ſaid that we ſhould driue the ſwallowes from the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="G"/> houſe; which hee ſaid to no other end; but becauſe that hee which dareth to ſhew himſelfe ingratefull for a pleaſure receiued, will ſhew himſelfe alſo ſuch, (as it is to be doubted) in all other actions, and forgetting how much he is bound vnto his countrey, he will one day be ſo bolde and hardie as to betray it. With good reaſon an ingratefull man is to be baniſhed from his Countrey, for he is noyſome to himſelfe, in this, that hee maketh himſelfe infamous, and is hurtfull likewiſe to others, becauſe that through his euill example, other men doubting to meete with ſuch ingratefull peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as he is, will doe pleaſure to no man. And this peraduenture is <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="H"/> that, which Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> meaneth when hee ſaith, that ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude emptieth and drieth vp the fountaine of pietie, that is to ſay, was the occaſion why men drue backe and withheld from doing good to others, through the example of ſome ingratefull man. And for this cauſe the Romanes tooke libertie and freedome from ingratefull ſlaues, being alreadie made free, and made them returne againe into bondage and ſeruitude: and children being ingratefull to their Parents, were diſinherited of their patrimonie, and ſo by this penaltie, they held both their ſeruants and their children in
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:13396:124"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="A"/> their dutie. I know that many excuſe themſelues, alleaging, that the importunitie of their benefactor, and the often caſting them in the teeth, with the good turne done them, giueth occaſion to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ingratefull; but I will anſwere theſe men, that although that ſuch a kinde of people be intollerable, ſeeing that their good turnes bring with them more offence than pleaſure, and that this manner of often reproching, maketh a man to deſire rather to forget them, than to acknowledge them: notwithſtanding all this, a noble and generous heart, ought to beare with ſome imperfection in the benefactor, and ought to remember, that to put a man in minde of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="B"/> a pleaſure, is one thing, and to caſt him in the teeth, and reproch him therewith, is another: for a man putteth his friends in minde of a pleaſure, and reprocheth his enemies: and ſometime the cauſe why a man is put in minde of a pleaſure done vnto him, commeth of the ſmall conſideration of the ingratefull heart of him, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the pleaſure towards his benefactor: which vſuallie ſo much moueth and offendeth a gentle heart, that ſometimes he is induced, and yeeldeth to doe worſe, and more vnworthie things, than the putting him in minde of a pleaſure done him. Ingratitude then can haue no excuſe, and by ſo much the leſſe, by how much the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="C"/> pleaſure hath been great, as that which the Sonne receiueth from the Father, the Citizen or Patriot from his Countrey; the Scholler from his Maſter, and the Subiect from his Prince: and when ſuch kinde of people ſhall riſe againſt their benefactors, and doe ſupport and ſerue their turnes againſt them, with the benefits which they haue receiued from them, they may iuſtlie bee called Mulets or young Mules, as <hi>Plato</hi> called <hi>Aristotle,</hi> who after that hee had lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned art and knowledge of <hi>Plato,</hi> was ſo vnthankfull and ingratefull for the pleaſure receiued, in hauing learned knowledge and ſcience of him, as to keepe open ſchoole in front, and as in deſpite of his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="D"/> Maſter: and as the young Mule, after it hath filled it ſelfe with the dammes milke, kicketh at her with the heeles; euen ſo an ingratefull man, after that he hath receiued a pleaſure, he turneth and beareth himſelfe impudently againſt his benefactor. In the time of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and aunceſters, <hi>Pontanus</hi> was reputed vnthankfull, who being nouriſhed and brought vp by <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Alfonſo</hi> Kings of Naples, and brought to that point to be ſo famous, &amp; a great perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage in learning and knowledge as he was, and little acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging this good, and ingratefull to his benefactors, made an oration in diſpraiſe of the King of Arragon, to the praiſe and commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:13396:125"/>of <hi>Charles</hi> the eight, King of France, vpon his Coronation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="E"/> day; and ſhewed that he had forgotten the many pleaſures which he had receiued by the houſe of Arragon; and with good reaſon deſerued to be reproued for vnthankefull: it was iudged that <hi>Ponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> repenting to haue made this oration, buried it in perpetuall darkenes, and would not that it ſhould come to light with his other workes, as he which wiſely iudged it to be expedient to cut from the world, the teſtimonie of his ingratitude, although that in one part he did not ill, with praiſe to extoll the warlike King of France. Behold (gentle Reader) theſe Conſiderations of the Lord <hi>Remy</hi> of Florence, who purpoſed to haue proceeded if death had not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="F"/> him.</p>
